🃏 High Card Duel – A Two-Player Card Game
A fast-paced two-player card game where each player draws a card and the one with the highest value wins. It's a simple and fun project showcasing DOM manipulation, state management, and game logic.


⚙️ How It's Made
Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML and  JavaScript

Framework :

The game randomly assigns a card to each player from a virtual deck using JavaScript. Each round compares the card values and displays the winner. The UI updates dynamically based on player actions, with animations to enhance interactivity.

Core features:

Virtual deck of standard 52 cards

Card comparison logic (Ace high, standard suit rules)

Game reset and replay options

Winner announcement with styling feedback

🚀 Optimizations
Refactored the card draw and comparison logic to make it more modular and scalable.

Minimized reflows and repaints by batching DOM updates during game state changes.

📚 Lessons Learned
Building this game gave me hands-on experience with game loop logic and dynamic UI rendering. I learned the value of modularizing logic early to allow for future expansion (like multiplayer or suit-based scoring). It also emphasized the importance of providing immediate user feedback through animations and real-time updates.
